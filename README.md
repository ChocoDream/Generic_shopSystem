# Generic_shopSystem

Making a blacksmith program made in Java for school assignment to see if I understand the basic concepts of Java Programming as a whole. 
Using enum for menu, generic methods for printing out from arraylists and to save data to arraylists.
Using both do while loops, for loops and foreach loops. However have no while loop because I prefer to use do while loops instead for their greater usage compared to normal while loops.
Rn have no jUnit testing or jDoc but shall be added very soon. Using factory-based to create accounts and singleton for menu showing and error-printing.
